//the lower part of an array is maintained to be sorted.
// An element which is to be 'insert'ed in this sorted sub-list,
// has to find its appropriate place and then it has to be inserted there. Hence the name, insertion sort.
//The array is searched sequentially and unsorted items are moved and inserted into the
// sorted sub-list (in the same array). This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its
// average and worst case complexity are of ÎŸ(n2), where n is the number of items.
